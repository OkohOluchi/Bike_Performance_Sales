1. The United States generated the highest revenue, followed by Australia. In contrast, the United Kingdom recorded the lowest revenue, closely followed by Canada, 
showing a significant gap between the top and bottom performing markets. Recommendation: Strengthen marketing and promotional strategies in the UK and 
Canada to close the revenue gap, Investigate market conditions, customer preferences, and distribution challenges in these regions.

2. Female customers generated higher revenue ($216,049) and profit ($97,543) compared to male customers revenue ($147,478) Profit($67,008). Recommendation: 
Focus on marketing campaigns and promotions on female customers the most profitable segment, explore strategies to increase engagement with male customers to 
balance contributions.

contributed only (9.72%). Recommendation: Prioritize product offerings and campaigns for Adults and young Adults the primary revenue drivers, introduce entry
level promotions or discounts for Youth to increase adoption and build future loyalty.

4. The Mountain 200 Black 46 achieved the highest revenue ($78,030) and order quantity (34 orders),while Mountain 200 Black 38 followed with ($61,965) revenue 
and (27 orders), Low performers by quantity included Mountain 500 Silver 40 and Mountain 100 Silver 44, each with only 1 order, although the Mountain 100 Silver 
44 ranked higher in revenue due to its higher unit price. Mountain 500 Black 42 also showed weak demand with only 2 orders. Recommendation: Prioritize 
inventory, marketing, and promotions for the Mountain 200 black 46 and 38 series, Reassess pricing strategy for high priced but low demand bikes (e.g., Mountain 
100 Silver 44),use discounts, bundles, or seasonal offers to stimulate sales of underperforming models (Mountain 500 series), Conduct customer preference analysis
